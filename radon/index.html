        <h2>What is Radon?</h2>
        <p>Radon is a naturally occurring radioactive gas that is tasteless, odorless, and colorless.</p>
        <p>It results in the breaking down of Radium and Uranium in the Earth's soil. In Minnesota it has been estimated that 2 in 5 homes have Radon leves that are above the safety recommendation.</p>

  			<h2>The Health Effects Radon</h2>
        <p class="lead">Second only to smoking, Radon is the leading cause of lung cancer in the United States.</p>
        <p>As Radon decays it releases small bursts of energy that can alter cells.</p>
        <p>The problem is that when you inhale Radon into your lungs it continues to decay into finer particles that can implant themselves perfectly into the lungs.</p>
        <p>This could potentially initiate cancer.</p>
