        <h2>What is Radon?</h2>
        <p class="lead">Radon is a naturally occurring radioactive gas that is tasteless, odorless, and colorless.</p>
        <p>It results in the breaking down of Radium and Uranium in the Earth's soil. In Minnesota it has been estimated that 2 in 5 homes have Radon leves that are above the safety recommendation.</p>
        <p>Outdoors the Radon gas dissipates quickly into the open air rendering it harmless. Indoors it can accumulate leading to elevated levels of Radon in the air resulting in health complications.</p>

  			<h2>The Health Effects of Radon</h2>
        <p class="lead">Second only to smoking, Radon is the leading cause of lung cancer in the United States.</p>
        <p>As Radon decays it releases small bursts of energy that can alter cells.</p>
        <p>The problem is that when you inhale Radon into your lungs it continues to decay into finer particles that can implant themselves perfectly into the lungs.</p>
        <p>This could potentially initiate cancer.</p>

          <h3>How Radon Enters a Structure</h3>
          <p>As of January 1st, 2014 sellers are now required to provide buyers with a detailed disclosure.</p>
          <p>The Office of the Surgeon General recommends that all homes be tested because it's the only way to tell if Radon levels are above a safe level.</p>
