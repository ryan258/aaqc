        <h3>Initial Contact</h3>
  			<p>Following an initial customer contact our air quality consultant will set up an appointment to meet with the customer at the affected structure.  Our 	consultant will use appropriate professional equipment to take numerous 	air samples including at least one sample outside the structure.</p>

      <h3>Inspection</h3>
  		<p>Our consultant will observe the occupants’ current health conditions and 	general structure to determine the appropriate air samples to take with an 	Air-O-Cell cassette.  At a minimum, our air quality consultant may need to 	inspect under carpets and pads, behind trim board, in air ducts, and in light sockets/fixtures.</p>

        <h3>Testing</h3>
  			<p>Photographs of affected areas and locations of air samples will be documented in a report to be presented later. Our consultant collects the recommended air sample(s) and sends them to an official AAQC laboratory for analysis.</p>
