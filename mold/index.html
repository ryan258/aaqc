  			<p>Mold naturally and continuously occurs around us, inside and outside of structures.  Two common factors contributing to mold growth are inadequate ventilation and moisture intrusion.  The three factors that encourage further mold growth are food, moisture, and temperature.  Take any one of these factors away and the mold cannot grow.</p>

  				<h2>Justification</h2>
  				<p>Mold testing by a skilled investigator can provide valuable justification for the cost of remediation as well as documentation that diagnosis was done.  While our laboratory tests can prove useful in detecting the existence of dangerous levels of mold, our company also routinely conducts visual inspections of the property or structure to identify potential sources.  Any indoor mold growth is a problem.</p>

  				<h2>Symptoms</h2>
  				<p>The effects of exposure to even low levels of mold can manifest rapidly over the course of months and years.  The quantity and type of mold along with the time of exposure can have various ramifications on individuals.  Allergies are often aggravated by mold spores and can lead to sinus and respiratory infections including increased coughing, shortness of breath, and asthma flare-ups.</p>
